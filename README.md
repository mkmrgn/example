# Go example project

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/golang.org/x/example.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/example)

This repository is a fork of the basic Golang example repo, trimmed down to contain a single example.

## Build the project

```
$ cd hello
$ go build
```

A simple application that takes a command line argument, and then returns it to you in a string. 

From the root directory, run `$ chmod +x hello/hello` to change the permissions of the file, granting the file executable permissions. 
You can then execute the file with an argument, in this case John Doe. To execute the file,  run `$ ./hello/hello Henna Abbas`. This will return 'Hello, Henna Abbas!'.
